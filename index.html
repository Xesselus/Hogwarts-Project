          Gryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
          and Wizardry and was founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor
          instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing
          characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, and
          determination,[4] to be sorted into his house. The emblematic animal
          was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold.[2] Sir Nicholas de
          Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the House
          ghost.[6] Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and
          it was for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen
          to represent the house.[2] The colour of fire corresponded to that of
          a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold
          representing the coat.

          Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, O.M. (First Class),
          Grand Sorc., D. Wiz., X.J. (sorc.), S. of Mag.Q.[24] (c. Summer[1]
          1881[3] - 30 June, 1997)[3] was an English half-blood wizard. He was
          the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, later the Transfiguration
          Professor, and later the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
          and Wizardry. He also served as Supreme Mugwump of the International
          Confederation of Wizards (1995) and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot
          (-1995; 1996-1997). A Muggle-supporting wizard, he was considered to
          have been the greatest wizard of modern times, perhaps of all time. He
          was the son of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and the elder brother
          of Aberforth and Ariana. His father died in Azkaban when Albus was
          young, while his mother and sister were later accidentally killed. His
          early losses greatly affected him early on, even at his death many
          years later, but, in turn, made him a better person.

          Harry James[58] Potter (b. 31 July 1980)[1] was an English
          half-blood[2] wizard, and one of the most famous wizards of modern
          times. The only child and son of James and Lily Potter (née Evans),
          Harry's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself or
          Neville Longbottom as the one with the power to vanquish Lord
          Voldemort, the most powerful and feared Dark Wizard in the world.
          After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy of
          Severus Snape, Harry was chosen as the target due to his many
          similarities with the Dark Lord. In turn, this caused the Potter
          family to go into hiding. Voldemort made his first attempt to
          circumvent the prophecy when Harry was a year and three months old.
          During this attempt, he murdered Harry's parents as they tried to
          protect him, but this unsuccessful attempt to kill Harry led to
          Voldemort's first downfall. This downfall marked the end of the First
          Wizarding War, and to Harry henceforth being known as "The Boy Who
          Lived",[5] as he was the only known survivor of the Killing Curse due
          to being magically protected by his mother's loving sacrifice. As per
          the terms of the prophecy, this attempt on his life also established
          him, not Neville, as Voldemort's nemisis.

          Ravenclaw was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
          and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw.[1]
          Members of this house were characterised by their wit, learning, and
          wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze
          were its colours.[6] The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick,[7][9]
          and the House ghost was the Grey Lady,[6] real name Helena Ravenclaw,
          daughter of Rowena.[10] Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element
          of air,[17] and it was for that reason that the House colours were
          chosen; blue and bronze represented the sky and eagle feathers
          respectively, both having much to do with air.[18] The Ravenclaw
          points hourglass contained blue sapphires.

          Alley during most of the 20th century. Ollivander was widely
          considered the best wandmaker in the world, and many wizards and
          witches bought their wands from him. In 1996, Ollivander was captured
          and tortured by Lord Voldemort. He was rescued in 1998 by Harry
          Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Dobby. He imparted
          important information regarding wandlore to Harry, it helped him in

          Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, O.M. (Third Class), (b. 26 January,[1][2]
          1964)[3] was a half-blood wizard, a Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts
          School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and later a famous wizarding
          celebrity who authored many books on dark creatures and his supposed
          encounters with them.[1] Prior to his tenure as Professor of Defence
          Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
          specifically during the 1992–1993 school year, he received many
          prestigious awards, such as Order of Merlin, Third Class; Honorary
          Member of the Dark Force Defence League; and the Witch Weekly's Most
          Charming Smile Award five times in a row.[5] He invented an Occamy egg
          yolk shampoo at some point. This shampoo, however, was too dangerous
          and expensive for open market; it subsequently became his dream to be
          able to market and sell the product.[14] His favourite colour was
          lilac.[5]

          houses, valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair
          play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.[5][7] The
          emblematic animal was a badger,[3] and yellow and black were its house
          colours.[2] The Head of Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout,[9] and the Fat
          Friar was the House's patron ghost.[7] Hufflepuff corresponded roughly
          to the element of earth,[4] and it was for that reason that the House
          colours were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was
          emblematic of soil.[2] The Hufflepuff point hourglass contained yellow
          diamonds.[15] Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrated
          exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to
          earth.

          Slytherin was one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
          and Wizardry, founded by Salazar Slytherin.[1] In establishing the
          house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a
          few particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics
          included cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition. Many
          Slytherin students tended to clique together, often acquiring leaders,
          which further exemplified Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of
          these included Draco Malfoy's gang, Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy
          Parkinson's gang and the Death Eaters. The founder highly valued and
          favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it
          could be a factor when being sorted.[1][17] Students of any blood
          status could be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-born student
          from that house was considered to be quite rare.[18] The emblematic
          animal of the house was a snake and the house's colours were green and
          silver. There were two notable heads of the house; Horace Slughorn
          took the role twice (first leaving in 1981 and then taking the role
          again from 1997 until leaving before 2016),[11] and Severus Snape.[12]
          The patron ghost of the house was the Bloody Baron.[9] Slytherin
          corresponded roughly with the element of water due to serpents being
          commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European
          mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible
          animals.[5] Similarly, in Celtic mythology, water is seen as a portal
          to another world, leading some to speculate that the element was
          chosen to symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pure-blood only
          community. The colours also corresponded with waters around lakes and
          lochs often being green, and silver being often associated with grey
          rainwater.

          nine. He fell deeply in love with Lily upon their meeting and became a
